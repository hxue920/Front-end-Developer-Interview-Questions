Variable set to null means it has no value.  Variable set to undefined means its value exists but has yet to be assigned to it.  Undeclared variable means the variable itself doesn't not exist.

You can check if a variable is null or undefined by checking if it has a 'truthy' value.  You can check if a variable is declared or not by using the typeof operator.
